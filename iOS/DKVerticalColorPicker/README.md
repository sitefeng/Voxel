# DKVerticalColorPicker
DKVerticalColorPicker is a simple iOS color picker presented as a vertical color bar from which the user can pick a color by its hue. *Wings* on either side of the color bar indicate the currently selected color. A small subclass of UIView, it is useful for simple applications - places where picking saturation, brightness, and alpha don't matter. It is similar in design to the color picker used in SnapChat's photo capture screen.

## Features
* Resizable/little space usage - set DKVerticalColorPicker's frame to be whatever makes sense for your application
* Reports color changes to a delegate
* IBDesignable and IBInspectable - set the initial color in IB
* Teeny tiny codebase with no dependencies

## Installation
Simply copy `DKVerticalColorPicker.m` and `DKVerticalColorPicker.h` into your project.  If there is demand, I may package a CocoaPod.

## Usage
You can drag a `UIView` out in IB and set its class as `DKVerticalColorPicker` or you can instantiate it in code via `initWithFrame`. Make it whatever size suits your app.  Either way, you'll want to set its `delegate` property to a class that implements the protocol `DKVerticalColorPickerDelegate`.

`DKVerticalColorPickerDelegate` defines a single method `colorPicked:` which is triggered every time the picker's color changes (either via user interaction or after the `selectedColor` property is set in code). 

You can set the color manually by simply setting the property `selectedColor`.

## Tips
* If you use `DKVerticalColorPicker` in IB, set its `backgroundColor` to `ClearColor` for things to look right.
* If you change `selectedColor` programatically, note that the delegate will be notified of a color change
